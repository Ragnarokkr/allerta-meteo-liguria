<ui-info-box header="2. Installation and Use of the Extension">

The only official source from which to install the Allerta Meteo Liguria extension is the [Chrome Web Store][webstore]. If you have installed it from other sites that are not the official ones of the browser used, you may encounter security issues with your personal data.

Once the extension is installed, no further actions are required from the user. The extension can retrieve information from the Civil Protection website and automatically inform about any changes made to this information.

However, the user can configure the extension through the options page to modify the links to the Civil Protection and ARPAL pages, as well as the interval at which the extension retrieves information.

<ui-info-box header="3. Troubleshooting">

In case of malfunctions, the causes could be various:

- **Corrupted GPU cache**: Sometimes the memory and/or cache of the GPU can become corrupted due to a malfunctioning graphics card driver or a forced browser shutdown, leading to blank screens. Restarting the browser might resolve the issue.
- **Information loading errors**: Due to the way data is retrieved from the Civil Protection page, any small change in the site's code could make it impossible to access this information. Updating the extension might resolve the issue. If the problem persists, wait a while and try again (it could be an issue with the Civil Protection server).
- **Corruption of extension data**: Despite efforts to avoid data corruption during updates, it can sometimes happen. Uninstalling and reinstalling the extension might resolve the issue.
- **Support via Web Store**: If you are unable to find a solution to your problem, you can contact the [support service][webstoresupport] of the Chrome Web Store.
